TODO:

1. inherit state "secured" property (decorator like 'data' on config)
2. add "fetchingRoles" to config, remove assumption about getting roles from login
    and return the actual login promise



security guards

path guard - asks questions...
    is this path secured?
    show me an access card (temp id)...
    is this person allowed in this path?



render guard -
 should you be allowed to see this portion of the template?

http guard
should you be allowed to see this data?

login phase -

login http request -> response logic -> roles, permissions, (token / session id)
